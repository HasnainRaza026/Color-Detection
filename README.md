# Color Detector
This Python openCV Color Detector program is developed to detect the defined colors, and display them in a bounding box

## Modules
First create **Virtual Enviroment** in the directory, each Virtual Enviroment has their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories.

Install the Virtual Enviroment by running this command in your terminal
```py
pip install virtualenv
```

Create the Virtual Enviroment using
```py
 python -m venv VirtualEnvironmentName
```

Finally activate the Virtual Enviroment
```py
VirtualEnvironmentName/Scripts/activate
```

### OpenCV
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **image processing** and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems.

OpenCV can be directly downloaded and installed with the use of pip (package manager).
```py
pip install opencv-python
```

To check if OpenCV is correctly installed, just run the following commands to perform a version check:
```py
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
```
